                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Defeasible reasoning is a vital component of many intelligent systems, as it provides a way to reason about uncertain or exceptional information. Rational closure has been at the forefront of research in defeasible reasoning, serving as a basis for a class of rational defeasible entailment relations. This project aims to provide insight into previously unexplored methods of generating these rational defeasible entailment relations, via Bayesian Inference and user-defined rankings. Finally, a parameterised tool for creating large, defeasible knowledge bases will be created to facilitate testing and validation of such defeasible entailment relations. The findings of this project can provide insights into the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of these forms of entailment, and how they compare to rational closure and lexicographic closure.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <h3>KRR</h3>
                    <p>Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on organizing and structuring information in a way that machines can comprehend, and then using that structured knowledge to draw inferences, make decisions, and solve complex problems. It is fundamental in enabling AI systems to understand, reason about, and interact with the world, making it a central component of AI research and development.</p>

                    <h3>Classical Reasoning</h3>
                    <p>Classical reasoning is a deterministic form of reasoning where statements must be either true or false, with no room for uncertainty. Propositional logic is a fundamental branch of classical logic that deals with the analysis of relationships between various statements, expressed as propositions. For instance, "penguin" is a proposition, as is "flies".</p>

                    <div style="display:flex;gap:1em;">
                        <p style="flex-basis: 100%;"><b>Syntax:</b> Propositional logic combines propositions, also known as atoms, using logical operators (¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔) to make more complex statements, known as formulas. A knowledge base is a set of such formulas.</p>

                        <p style="flex-basis: 100%;"><b>Semantics:</b> Truth arises from interpretations, often referred to as "worlds", which assign truth values (true or false) to atoms. When a formula is true under some interpretation it is said to be "satisfied", and any such interpretation is said to be a "model" of that formula.</p>

                        <p style="flex-basis: 100%;"><b>Entailment:</b> "Entailment" describes a scenario where one or more statements necessarily follow from one or more other statements. In classical reasoning, when a statement is entailed by a knowledge base, this entailment cannot be retracted. When every model of a knowledge base is also a model of some other statement, it is said to entail that statement.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Defeasible Reasoning</h3>
                    <p>In contrast to classical reasoning's reliance on absolute truth, real-world scenarios often involve uncertainty and exceptions. Defeasible reasoning accommodates these uncertainties by allowing for the retraction of statements under specific conditions. It involves reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information, acknowledging multiple possible "parallel" worlds without identifying the precise one.</p>

                    <p>One prominent framework for defeasible reasoning is the Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor (KLM) framework, which incorporates preferential reasoning to model the typicality of different situations or objects. This framework assigns preferences to possible worlds, allowing the expression of defeasible implications that hold "typically" rather than absolutely.</p>

                    <h3>Rational Closure</h3>
                    <p>Defeasible entailment allows the retraction of statements that were previously entailed, given additional information. Rational closure is a method of computing defeasible entailment that centers on the principle of “presumption of typicality,” assuming statements to be as typical as possible. Rational closure works by ranking information according to its level of typicality, this can be done by ranking either statements, or worlds.</p>

                    <p>Rational closure has been shown to be the most conservative form of defeasible entailment, making it a good starting point for more complex forms. Our aim is to investigate the development of such forms of defeasible entailment, while also considering the practical implications of doing so.</p>

                    <h2>Defeasible Knowledge Base Generator</h2>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>A defeasible knowledge generator was developed to facilitate the testing of the new defeasible entailment relations. It is capable of generating knowledge bases with varying complexities and structures.</p>

                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    The aims of this part of the project were to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a non-deterministic algorithm, capable of generating defeasible knowledge bases, organized in a manner aligned with Base Rank's ranking of a knowledge base.</li>
                        <li>Develop an optimized variant of the knowledge base generator.</li>
                        <li>Compare the performance of the standard and optimized generators and evaluate the impact of defeasible implication complexity on the computation time of generation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                    Two algorithms, KBGenerator and KBGeneratorThreaded, were developed to facilitate knowledge base generation. Their features include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number defeasible implications (DIs)​</li>
                        <li>Number of ranks​</li>
                        <li>Distribution of DIs​</li>
                        <li>Simple/Mixed DI generation​</li>
                        <li>Adjustable Antecedent and Consequent complexity</li>
                        <li>Adjustable complex-DI connective types</li>
                        <li>Adjustable connective symbols</li>
                        <li>Adjustable atom character-set</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    The project resulted in the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The optimized generator had significant speedup over the standard generator.</li>
                        <li>However, the optimized generator had a higher percentage increase in execution time when the number of defeasible implications (DIs) increased compared to the standard generator. This trend was observed for both simple and complex defeasible implications.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge bases with complex defeasible implications took longer to generate compared to those with only simple defeasible implications.</li>
                        <li>The standard generator had a larger percentage increase in execution time between generating simple and complex DIs than the optimized generator.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Future Work</h3>
                    We can focus on these areas for future work:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tool can be used to perform more in-depth analysis on defeasible entailment relations.</li>
                        <li>Further improvements can be made to the pseudo-random recycling of atoms in DIs, along with more sophisticated thread management for the optimized generator. These modifications have the potential to yield significant performance improvements in generating complex defeasible implications.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>User-Defined Rankings</h2>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Classical logic focuses on deriving conclusions from a predefined knowledge base. Defeasible entailment takes this a step further by accommodating uncertain information. Rational closure, a key method for defeasible entailment, organizes the knowledge base into ranks based on statement base rank. However, for a more nuanced approach, a user-defined, K-faithful ranking of statements may be necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    This section of the project aimed to do the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design algorithms which take an arbitrary ranking of defeasible implications and return a valid (K-faithful) ranking.</li>
                        <li>Prove that our algorithm satisfies as many user preferences (rankings) as possible.</li>
                        <li>Prove that our algorithm outputs a K-faithful ranking.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                    We developed two algorithms: UnguidedUserRank and GuidedUserRank. They essentially did the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find defeasible implications which can be placed on rank i</li>
                        <li>Allow user to choose a subset of these</li>
                        <li>Ensure their choices are valid (they can’t omit a statement which is entailed by a statement they don’t omit)</li>
                        <li>Repeat</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    Given the designed algorithms, we had the following results:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The set of allowed defeasible implications is maximal. That is, the algorithm satisfies as many of the user's original preferences.</li>
                        <li>The ranking that UnguidedUserRank and GuidedUserRank output is K-faithful.</li>
                        <li>The ranking they output also retains minimality of worlds. That is, if a defeasible implication (with antecedent alpha) is assigned a rank of i by either algorithm, then the rank of the minimal alpha world in the corresponding ranked interpretation is also i.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Future Work</h3>
                    There are several areas for future work, building on the foundations layed out here. The most important are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>This tool can be for cognitive defeasible reasoning, where users are actually assessed and their reasoning is studied.</li>
                        <li>The algorithms can be made more efficient. Specifically, the steps for checking if the user's choices are valid can be memoized, or optimized using a completely different method.</li>
                    </ul>
